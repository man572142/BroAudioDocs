## Low Pass Filter

Allows signals below a specified frequency to pass through while attenuating those above the specified frequency. **It can cause the sound to become relatively Muffled or Muddy.**

## High Pass Filter

The opposite of a Low Pass Filter.  **It can cause the sound to become relatively Thin and Crispy.**



## **Real Voices and Virtual Voices**

In every software or hardware system, the number of sounds (or Voices) that can be played simultaneously is limited. When the number of sounds being played exceeds this limit, the excess sounds are converted into 'Virtual Voices'. These virtual voices are inaudible during playback, but their playback process continues in the background. As soon as any of the 'Real Voices' currently playing finishes, the corresponding virtual voice immediately becomes a real voice, thus becoming audible and continues to play until its end.
